## INTRODUCTION

Wong is a user-friendly, lightweight platform that allows users to :

1.  **CREATE**
2.  **SHARE**
3.  **VIEW ...**

(notion style) textual content without **AUTHENTICATION** that too for **FREE !!!**

## MOTIVATION

Wong was built to understand what, how and why is serverless.

After understanding I wanted to try it out and build something with a simple use-case that doesn't put on heavy load on [Cloudflare ☺️](https://www.cloudflare.com/)

Hence, Wong was born. 🤘

## TODO
- [ ] Init env variables rather than using static variables
- [ ] Drop down for below options or be creative enough and suggest other ways
- [ ] Add about us (preferred) or Made with love by Atif -> My Portfolio link (coming soon :3)
- [ ] Add github repo linking
    - add more ...

## FOSS

Yes, Wong is and will always be open-source so,

*   I'm open to feedback, suggestions, and constructive criticism.
*   Do raise a PR if you think you can fix something (please do :3)

### Credits

Shout out to [@harkirat](https://twitter.com/kirat_tw) and [@100xdevs](https://twitter.com/100xdevs) for introducing me to backend and serverless deployment in **Cohort 2.0**


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
